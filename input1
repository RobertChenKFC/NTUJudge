There are strings in the input,
one per line, with no more than
32 characters each. Note that
there could be spaces in each
line, so you should use fgets
or gets to read the input. And
you should determine the number
of strings using the return
value NULL of fgets/gets.  The
number of strings is no more
than 64.
